% This function obtains the power diagram specified by sites E with weights wts.
% It is optimised to work fast on large number of sites (e.g. 10000 sites or more).
% Only works for 2 dimensions.
% Input:
%   * E: a matrix that specifies the sites coordinates (Npts x 2)
%   * wts: a column vector that specifies the sites' weights (Npts x 1)
% Output:
%   * V: list of points' coordinates that makes the power diagram vertices.
%   * CE: cells that contains index of coordinate in V that makes the power diagram of a specified site.
